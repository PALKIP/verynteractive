## A Minecraft datapack complete with all the features you will ever need, and a thousand more just to be sure.

I started working on this piece of shit a year ago, and now i'll be shoving it in everyone's faces too.

Verynteractive currently adds:
- Armor trim abilities
  - every single armor trim has its own ability
  - wearing the same trim in more than one slot enhances its abilities sometimes unlocking new powers like xray for host
  ![](props/trims.gif)
- Enhanced mob drops
  - turtles drop their scutes
  - armadillos drop their scutes
  - nautilus drop their shells
  - villagers drop items based on their profession
- More enchantments
  - 50 new enchantments counting new curses too
  - some enchantments are for items that didn't have any unique enchantment before like the spyglass or the bundle

- Reworked enchanting table
  - in vanilla minecraft the game can offer at best level 30 enchantments, these go up to 120  
  ![](props/enchanting.gif)
- Foods give potion effects
  - every food has a chance to give its own potion effect
  - this gives players a reason to eat anything other than golden carrots
- Tombs
  - keeps all your items and levels
  - they also work in the void  
  ![](props/tomb.gif)
- Longer lasting and stackable potions
  - potions last 4 times as long
  - you can stack up to 16  
  ![](props/potions.gif)
- Fermenting potions in barrels
  - placing a barrel underground has it become a fermenting barrel
  - fermenting potions takes time, but they will last longer
  - depth decides the level, level decides duration mult
  - level 1 depth x6, level 2 depth x8, level 3 depth x12  
  ![](props/fermenting.gif)
- Creating potions in cauldrons
  - a mix between the brewing stand and the beacon, the range is very small tho  
  ![](props/cauldron_potion.gif)
- Cooking food in cauldrons
  - its slower but you get more  
  ![](props/cauldron_cook.gif)
- Creating giant hamburgers on furnaces  
![](props/burgers.gif)
- Jukeboxes potion effects  
![](props/discs.gif)
- Grindstone actually grinds your tools now
  - level 40 cap is no more
  - mending stock market crashes  
  ![](props/grindstone.gif)
- Goat horns give potion effects when used
  - why are screaming goat horns so hard to get? because they are useful thats why  
  ![](props/horns.gif)  
  ![](props/horns2.gif)
- Terraria modifiers to tools  
![](props/modifiers.gif)

- Rebalanced tools
  - wood is wood
  - stone is slow and heavy
  - copper is fast and heavy
  - iron is balanced
  - gold is very fast
  - diamond is fast
  - netherite is very fast and heavy
- Rebalanced enchantments
  - bane of arthropods and smite deal more extra damage
  - channeling works like in bedrock
  - blast/fire/projectile protection aren't overshadowed by protection anymore
  - unbreaking 4 and 5
- Better minecarts
  - i just oiled their wheels a tad  
  ![](props/minecarts.gif)
- Throwing Items
  - by shifting and pressing [Q] or whatever sick button you may use  
  ![](props/throwdrop.gif)
- Trident crafting
  - ever crafted a conduit?
- Dragon Breath crafting
  - the dragon heads were right there mojang RIGHT THERE
- Training dummies
  - sword are fine, but punching them is mean and breaks them
- Feeding farm mobs fattens them
  - doubles the loot and the health
  - works on any mob that can be fed
- Powered iron golems
  - bigger and stronger
- Powered copper golems
  - makes them work faster
- The two most useless flowers in existance do something too now
  - the sniffer is still crap, may the rascal rest in peace  
- Bug fixes
  - i fix snapshot bugs before the next-week patch so i can work and test verynteractive faster
  - its still just a datapack so i cant do much
- Libraries
  - the libs i created to work faster
  - Lapis (rte2, moves mobs) --> MotionLib (moves mobs) --> MotionWig (moves players but janky) --> VeryStockings | the motion datapack that actually applies motion to the player
  - Infinite Matrix (reads a book) + Command Book 2 (reads a book) + sara_talk (reads a dialog and uses ai) --> VeryVillagers (villagers have dialogs now) | this datapack contains an artificial intelligence, runs entirely using commands
  - THE MARKER HELL (rte2, uses markers to store mob and player data) --> THE MARKER HELL 2 (rte2 + verynteractive, uses markers to use storages to store mob and player data) --> air (verynteractive, same thing but faster) --> air2 (verynteractive, same thing but now mobs have the data thing so its only for players, also way faster than before) | this one is useful
  - VeryReady (verynteractive, wip) | reads the player inventory and replaces items with other items, its as fast as it is non functional
  - everything becomes Very* at some point, so all of my stuff will be here eventually

# QYMWTABIAARSHTA
### (questions you may want to ask but i am alway ready so here they are)
- when can i play this?
  - a week, a month if something important happens
- since when has this existed?
  - i started working on verynteractive on june 2024 when i realized rte2 had too many features, now i have 2 datapacks with too many features
- is verynteractive just a clusterfuck of features? is that really an enhancement of minecraft vanilla?
  - yes that is the point, features that coul be added by anyone, so why hasn't anyone added them yet? potions in cauldorns, materials with advantages and disadvantages, armor stands with arms, its easy... yet mojang wont do it
  - verynteractive isnt an enhancement to vanilla because its not vanilla, its not "vanilla-like", it dosn't need to be, i just made a datapack to have fun again on a game that hasn't been "REALLY UPDATED" in years, and no, a new weapon with 1(one) enchantment isnt an update (i made 2 in a day when it came out come on mojang), all goat horns, trims, discs having abilities and a reason to collect, thats an update
  - since some features are more extreme than others (es. creating hamburgers vs lighter minecarts) verynteractive will be configurable, dont want 50 new enchantments? you prefer armless armor stands?? YOU WANT TO FIGHT THE DRAGON AGAIN TO SHOOT 8 POISON ARROWS??? just get the version of the datapack without those things (they will all be available and updated together)

## what the hell did i just read?
